# Multiple choice test #

Multiple choice test has several multiple choice questions. 
Each question can have only one correct answer. 
Additionally, timed multiple choice test can specify 
the time allowed for solving each question in the test.

The code given satisfies this specification, 
but the customer complained that the memory usage 
of the program constantly increases. 

Fix this problem.

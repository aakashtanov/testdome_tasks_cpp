# Song #

A playlist is considered a repeating playlist 
if any of the songs contain a pointer 
to a previous song in the playlist. 

Otherwise, the playlist will end 
with the last song which points to `nullptr`.

Implement a function `isInRepeatingPlaylist` that, 
efficiently with respect to time used, 
returns `true` if a playlist is repeating or `false` if it is not.

For example, the following code prints `true` as both songs point to each other.

```c++
Song* first = new Song("Hello");
Song* second = new Song("Eye of the tiger");

first->next(second);
second->next(first);

std::cout << std::boolalpha << first->isInRepeatingPlaylist();
```

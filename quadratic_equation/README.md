# Quadratic equation #

Implement the function `findRoots` to find the roots of the quadratic equation:  
```
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
```
The function should return a pair containing both roots in any order.
If the equation has only one solution, the function should return that solution as both elements of the pair.
The equation will always have at least one solution.

For example, `findRoots(2, 10, 8)` should return a pair 
containing `(-1, -4)` or `(-4, -1)`
as the roots of the equation `2x^2 + 10x + 8 = 0` are `-1` and `-4`.
